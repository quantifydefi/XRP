      <p>
        By reading data on the coin ranking homepage and the individual coin pages, you agree that it is solely for
        informational purposes and that it is not meant for investment advice or solicitation. The term coin “rankings”
        refers to sorting the cryptocurrencies by market cap from greatest to least. The rankings are not an endorsement
        nor are they meant to entice you to take any sort of action. The coin ranking and coin listings are drawn
        directly from cryptocurrency exchanges, publicly available information from commercial-use APIs. EVM Finance
        does not generate ranking data. EVM Finance does not endorse or rate any cryptocurrencies listed or mentioned on
        our site, nor do we encourage or solicit you to invest in any cryptocurrency. Trading cryptocurrencies is
        considered a high-risk activity and EVM Finance strongly encourages you to perform due diligence before
        considering any trading.

        custody, or control over any user’s funds. Further, we do not store, send, or receive any cryptoassets. You
        understand that when you interact with any Protocol smart contracts, you retain control over your cryptoassets
        at all times. The private key associated with the wallet address from which you transfer cryptoassets or the
        private key associated is the only private key that can control the cryptoassets you transfer into the smart
        contracts. You alone are responsible for securing your private keys. We do not have access to your private keys.

        decisions or activities that you affect when using our Services. You acknowledge that we, for the avoidance of
        doubt, do not have any information regarding any users, users’ identities, or services beyond what is available
        or obtainable publicly via the blockchain. We are not responsible for any activities you engage in when using
        Services, and you should understand the risks associated with cryptoassets, blockchain technology generally, and
        our Services.
